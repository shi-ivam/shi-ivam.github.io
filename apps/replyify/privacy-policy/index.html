                    <strong>Comment Data:</strong> Our AI may analyze and
                    process comments made on your posts, including text content,
                    timestamps, and interactions, to generate appropriate auto

                and information available in the comment. These auto replies are
                designed to engage in meaningful conversations and enhance user
                experience.
